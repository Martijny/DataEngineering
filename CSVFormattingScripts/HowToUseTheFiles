Extract the required CSV files from Neo4J by downloading the relevant Nodes and Edges (there's an Export CSV button). 
Put all of the information underneath each other in one combined CSV file.
Use that CSV file as input for either the node or edges conversion script.
Run script and check if the outcome is actually in the correct format.
